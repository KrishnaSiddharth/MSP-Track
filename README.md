# MSP-Track
This repository contains the code, folders and files necessary to perform a particle tracking simulation of Meteor Smoke Particles (MSPs) across a rocket-borne Faraday Cup detector in the upper middle atmosphere. The detector is used to create a concentration vs altitude profile for the MSPs. The purpose of this code is to replicate the results and build upon the research presented in the paper "Hedin, J., J. Gumbel, and M. Rapp (2007), On the efficiency of rocket-borne particle detection in the mesosphere, Atmos. Chem. Phys. Discuss.,7, 1183â€“ 1214." (https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/7/3701/2007/acp-7-3701-2007.pdf). However in project I don't include the electric potential of the grid as its effect on MSPs with radii greater or equal to 1 nm are considered to be negligible in the paper itself. This claim however requires independent verification. The paper was authored by researchers who worked on the ECOMA project aimed at measuring the concentration of MSPs in the polar mesosphere (60km - 100 km altitude). The sounding rocket studies were conducted in the Andoya rocket range Norway.

Currently, the results of my code don't match with those presented in the paper. I am working to find out the reason. Any contribution to the code interms of bug identification or conceptual addition wouold be appreciated and mentioned in this description.
